I have been the first/only data scientist at two ecommerce companies, and shaped the foundations of how they approach and utilize their data.  

I work with company leaders to drive revenue, optimize profits, and improve productivity through data-driven strategy, tools, and analyses.  

I am a skilled coder and determined problem-solver with a strong background in advanced statistical concepts.  

I have devised strategies, built tools, and implemented procedures that have saved thousands of hours in labor and generated millions of dollars in additional revenue.
